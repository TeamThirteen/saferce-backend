Saferce is an application where users can find service providers closest to their home, having the differential of the provider's assessments based on their hygiene and safety items. In a world affected by COVID-19, it is extremely important to be able to access essential services but, at the same time, protect ourselves against any risk of contagion. The application also helps service providers and small businesses to gain visibility in the market, even in situations as unusual as this.

> This repository refers to the application backend.
